    <string name="dashbuddy_explainer">We make tracking your dashes easier!         Interactions in this app happen within its Bubble.  In addition to notifications, we also need to ask for some other permissions.         Please enable the following services:</string>

    <string name="post_notifications">Post Notifications</string>
    <string name="post_notifications_explainer">Allows DashBuddy to show important alerts and the floating bubble button. After enabling, tap the bubble button in the notification to start the service.</string>

    <string name="accessibility_service">Accessibility Service</string>
    <string name="accessibility_service_explainer">This is the core permission. It allows the app to read screen text from the Dasher app to automatically log offer details, track dash progress, and provide overlays.</string>

    <string name="location_access">Location Access</string>
    <string name="location_access_explainer">Needed to track mileage for tax purposes and to provide accurate delivery time estimates. Your location is only tracked during an active dash.</string>

    <string name="perm_pitch_accessibility">To act as your co-pilot, DashBuddy needs to read Dasher offers as they pop up and tap the screen to accept or decline them based on your rules.</string>
    <string name="perm_hood_accessibility">We use Android\'s AccessibilityService. Our engine only looks at the screen when the Dasher app is open. Strict \'Sensitive Screen\' blockers completely shut down our \'eyes\' if you open your bank app or personal texts.</string>

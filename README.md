## Dashbuddy

A dash tracking app (eventually) which can be used to track your dashes - earnings, mileage,
and other metrics.

Most boilerplate code is written by Gemini, with logical edits made by me.

- Uses Android Bubbles to present UI
- Only tracks mileage when it detects you are dashing.
- With the recent major update to doordash UI, things have broken:
    - dash detection (now fixed)
    - earnings tracking (still broke)

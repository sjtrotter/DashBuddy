# DashBuddy Field Testing Log

Running log of observations made while actively dashing in the field, captured
in real time during sessions. Each session is its own entry, **newest first**.

This is a freeform capture log — a mix of bugs, open questions, meta
observations about platform UI/UX, design proposals, and verification TODOs
that were noticed during a session. The intent is to preserve raw context
*before* it gets distilled into focused work items. Items here are not yet
triaged; the developer triages to the project board manually using the
Android Studio plugin or `gh` CLI.

## Format

Each session entry has:

- **Date** — YYYY-MM-DD
- **Platform(s) tested** — DoorDash, Uber, etc.
- **Branch under test** — the git branch the build came from
- **Field conditions** — anything that affects interpretation (offers
  accepted vs declined, weather, multi-app testing, etc.)
- **Observations** — grouped by kind:
  - **Bugs** — reproducible defects
  - **Field UX context** — what the platform's UI actually looks like in
    the wild; helps explain why a matcher behaves the way it does
  - **Open questions / investigations** — things to look at back at the desk
  - **Meta / architecture** — broader concerns that aren't single-bug shaped
  - **Research / design** — speculative or strategic proposals
  - **Verification TODOs** — items the session itself produced ground-truth
    for, but which need cross-referencing against captured data

Item numbers are **session-local** (reset each session) and intended for
cross-referencing within a single session entry, not across sessions.

## 2026-05-16 — DoorDash session (stacked pickups)

- **Platform tested:** DoorDash
- **Branch under test:** `master` at `af54b87` (post-#145 personal-economy-v2 merge — same build as the entry below)
- **Field conditions:** developer dashed on DoorDash and ran a stacked / double static order — two pickup stops at different merchants (first Best Buy, then Chick-fil-A), roughly a mile apart by car odometer. After the run, the in-app odometer read a few tenths of a mile short of the car odometer.

### Bugs

#### 1. Multi-stop pickup: second store doesn't register as a new pickup, and the inter-store drive isn't counted on the odometer

- **Repro:** Take a stacked order with two distinct pickup stops at different merchants. Complete pickup #1 (arrive, mark picked up — note that with a double *static* order you don't fully complete pickup #1 in the DoorDash UI, the platform just rolls you toward the next store while phase stays PICKUP). Drive to store #2.
- **Observed:** On approach to the second store, the bubble's store name updates from "Best Buy" to "Chick-fil-A". The app does **not** treat this as a new pickup — no "Pickup Started" bubble announcement, no new pickup lifecycle event. The drive between the two stores (~1 mi by car odometer) does not get counted; the dash mileage ends up a few tenths short of the car for the day, consistent with the entire inter-store leg being dropped.
- **Expected:** Each store on a stacked run should be its own pickup — at minimum because the dasher has to navigate to the next store, so the mileage between them is real and unreimbursed if we don't log it. TNP per stop also wants per-store mileage attribution.
- **Framing (per the log narrative):** the missing odometer leg is almost certainly a downstream symptom of the missing pickup-transition event, so this is one entry covering both observations rather than two separate bugs.
- **Hypothesis (from a desk read, not verified against field logs):**
  - `PlatformRegionStepper.kt:401-441` is the smoking gun. The stepper branches on `currentTask.phase != taskPhase`. PICKUP → DROPOFF (or DROPOFF → PICKUP across orders) mints a new `Task` at `:409-425`. PICKUP → PICKUP (second pickup of a stack) falls into the same-phase `copy()` branch at `:430-441` and just mutates `storeName` on the existing `activeTask`. Same `taskId`, no transition boundary.
  - `EffectMap.kt:308-333` is the only path that emits `ResumeOdometer` for a starting pickup, and it's gated on `prevTask == null && nextTask != null` — false for a store-to-store mutation.
  - `EffectMap.kt:380-414` does detect the store-name change (`storeChanged` at `:387-388`) and emits a bubble update + a `PICKUP_NAV_STARTED` log entry titled "Store Name Updated" — but it does **not** emit any odometer effect.
  - Meanwhile `EffectMap.kt:361` fires `PauseOdometer` on first arrival at store #1. So the sequence is: arrive at Best Buy → `PauseOdometer` → drive to Chick-fil-A → storeName mutated in place → bubble & log update but **no `ResumeOdometer`** → odometer stays paused for the entire inter-store leg. That matches the "few tenths short" observation almost exactly.
- **What would confirm or refute this:** capture the state/effect stream across the Best Buy → Chick-fil-A handoff and check:
  - (a) does `activeTask.taskId` change across the two stores, or stay constant?
  - (b) is there a `PauseOdometer` on Best Buy arrival followed by **no** `ResumeOdometer` until Chick-fil-A arrival (or until something further downstream)?
  - (c) does the events table show a `PICKUP_NAV_STARTED` row with payload `{message: "Store Name Updated", previous: "Best Buy", updated: "Chick-fil-A"}` and no associated odometer delta between it and the prior arrival event?
- **Possible directions (sketches for triage, not a recommendation):**
  - *Option A — make the second store a real new pickup.* In `PlatformRegionStepper.updateTaskLifecycle`, treat a same-phase store-name change as a task boundary: complete the current `Task` and mint a new one. Existing `EffectMap.kt:308-333` wiring then resumes the odometer for free, and per-store mileage attribution falls out naturally.
  - *Option B — minimal patch in EffectMap.* Leave the in-place mutation alone, but emit `ResumeOdometer` from the `storeChanged` branch at `EffectMap.kt:380-414`. Smaller blast radius, but the schema still says "one task, multiple store legs," which probably bites later — TNP per stop wants the mileage bound to the *new* pickup, not appended to the previous one.
  - *Trade-off worth flagging:* option A is more invasive in the stepper and may surface latent assumptions in code that reads `region.activeTask` expecting it to be stable across a job. Option B is cheap but defers the data-model problem.
- **Tangentially related, worth checking while in this neighborhood:** does this affect single-pickup jobs that hot-swap store name during the unknown-resolution window (e.g. "Unknown" → real name once the matcher figures it out)? `:387-388` filters `nextName != "Unknown"`, so the *first* resolution probably doesn't trip the storeChanged branch, but a string-rewrite mid-pickup (e.g. "Best Buy" → "Best Buy #1234") would.

## 2026-05-16 — DoorDash session

- **Platform tested:** DoorDash
- **Branch under test:** `master` at `af54b87` (post-#145 personal-economy-v2 merge — the build that introduced the cost-breakdown bubble HUD)
- **Field conditions:** developer dashed on DoorDash; mix of accepts and declines.

### Bugs

#### 1. DoorDash decline → bubble says "Offer Timed Out" instead of "Offer Declined"

- **Repro:** Receive a DoorDash offer, tap **Decline**, confirm **Decline offer** in the dialog.
- **Observed:** Bubble shows "Offer Timed Out!" and the event is logged as `OFFER_TIMEOUT`. The decline isn't recognized at all.
- **Expected:** "Offer Declined" / `OFFER_DECLINED`.
- **Acceptance appears to work** correctly in the same session — only decline is broken.
- **Hypothesis (from a quick desk read, not verified against field logs):** the decline flow is two clicks. First tap on the offer popup fires intent `initial_decline` and opens an "are you sure?" confirmation dialog; the confirm tap fires `decline_offer`. The confirm rule (`core/pipeline/src/main/assets/rules/doordash.json:2319-2328`) is gated on `screenIs: "offer_popup_confirm_decline"`. If the dialog closes before the click observation is matched against the dialog's screen classification, only `initial_decline` may end up on `PendingOffer.lastClickIntent`. `EffectMap.resolveOfferOutcome` (`core/state/.../EffectMap.kt:563-581`) only recognizes `decline_offer` / `accept_offer`, so any case where `decline_offer` doesn't land would fall through to `OFFER_TIMEOUT`.
- **What would confirm or refute this:** capture the click + screen event stream for a real decline session and check (a) whether the `offer_popup_confirm_decline` screen is being matched at all, and (b) which `lastClickIntent` value `PendingOffer` actually carries at the moment the offer resolves. If `initial_decline` is the value seen, the hypothesis above holds; if `lastClickIntent` is null/something else, the cause is elsewhere (rule text drift, ViewPipeline drop, dialog never matched as a screen, etc.).
- **One possible direction (if hypothesis holds):** treat `initial_decline` as a decline signal in `resolveOfferOutcome`. Worth considering vs. alternatives like making the confirm rule less screen-strict, or matching clicks against the screen at click-time rather than after the screen has changed. Not a recommendation — just a sketch for triage.

### Research / design

#### 2. Bubble HUD live $/hr is inflated right after accept

- **Field observation:** Immediately after accepting an offer and starting navigation, the bubble's order $/hr reads something like "$120/hr" because almost no time has elapsed. It re-anchors to a sensible number only after several minutes, by which time the dasher has already been looking at a misleading number that gives false confidence.
- **Why it matters:** every brand-new offer looks like a win at this point — the live rate is meaningless until enough elapsed time has passed for `payAmount / elapsed` to be informative. False optimism is worse than no number.
- **Proposal (developer's first instinct, exploratory — "I'm not sure, though"):** consider suppressing the live $/hr display until it actually drops *below* the offer's originally-projected $/hr. Above projection → silent (you're on or ahead of pace, nothing to act on). Below projection → display starts, because that's where the number becomes actionable ("I'm losing margin the longer this drags").
- **Where the wiring appears to live, for triage:**
  - Live rate is computed in `BubbleScreen.formatDollarsPerHour()` (`app/src/main/java/.../ui/bubble/BubbleScreen.kt:897-906`) as `earnings / hours` with a 60-second "--" gate (gate is on display only, not on signal).
  - `BubbleViewModel` currently captures only `payAmount` into `lastAcceptedOfferPay` on the offer→task-flow transition (`BubbleViewModel.kt:78-97`); the projected $/hr from `OfferEvaluation` isn't carried forward into the task flows, so the bubble doesn't currently have the projection to compare against.
- **Tradeoff to consider:** hide-until-below also hides the metric for the entire expected duration of the order, so if the projection was way off (bad merchant estimate, unexpected traffic), the dasher wouldn't see the problem until late. Alternative shape: always show, but mute/desaturate when above projection and escalate color when below. Not a recommendation — just two shapes to weigh.

## 2026-05-09 — Uber session

- **Platform tested:** Uber Driver
- **Branch under test:** `feature/click-rule-overhaul` (commit `90200bc`)
- **Field conditions:** developer dashed on Uber; accepted every offer
  received during the session.

### Bugs

#### 1. Uber: bubble stays "offline" after going online

- **Repro:** Tap "Go online" in Uber Driver.
- **Observed:** Bubble shows offline state. A "started dashing" notification
  appears (note: that notification's UI copy is stale — hasn't been updated
  for the multi-platform world — but that's a separate cosmetic concern).
- **Expected:** Bubble enters online/dashing state.
- **Likely cause:** `uber.click.go_online` intent
  (`app/src/main/assets/rules/uber.json:184-190`) fires the rule, but no
  handler in `state/EffectMap.kt` reacts to `go_online`. DoorDash's
  start-of-session path produces `AppEffect.StartDash`
  (`state/EffectMap.kt:184`); there's no Uber-equivalent wiring.
- **Proposed fix:** unify the intent vocabulary across platforms — rename
  DoorDash's start-dash click intent to `go_online` (or whatever shared
  term fits), rename `AppEffect.StartDash` → `StartSession` (or similar
  platform-neutral term), and remove DoorDash-specific language elsewhere
  in the state machine. Single intent, single handler, both platforms route
  through it.

#### 2. Uber: online/offline screen recognition flaps

- **Observed:** Immediately after going online, the screen matcher appears
  to oscillate between online and offline classifications.
- **Likely contributor to #1** — even with the intent wired up, a flapping
  classifier may immediately clobber the new state.
- **Field UX context (helps explain):** Uber has *two* surfaces from which
  a driver can go online or offline:
  - The **dashboard** (post-splash home screen) has a "start Ubering"
    button.
  - Tapping the map widget opens the **full map screen**, which has its own
    "Go" button.
  - Going offline is symmetrical: end from the map, or back out to the
    dashboard and end from there.
  - So "online" and "offline" each have **two valid screens** with different
    layouts. A matcher keying on a single UI element only present on one
    surface will flip when the user moves between them.
- **Hypothesis:** the current matcher is too strict — keying on a single UI
  telltale that's only present on one of the two surfaces.
- **Action:** capture all four screens (online-dashboard, online-map,
  offline-dashboard, offline-map), find a robust common signal per state,
  relax/rework the matcher.

#### 3. Uber offer TTS reads raw text; offer shape not standardized across platforms

- **Repro:** Receive an Uber offer with TTS announcement enabled.
- **Observed:** TTS reads minutes-as-miles (a field-mapping bug in the
  Uber parser), then continues reading the raw screen string — so the user
  hears the parsed-wrong value *and* the real miles trailing in the verbatim
  text.
- **Expected:** TTS speaks a constructed message built from parsed fields,
  not raw screen text.
- **Underlying problem — offer parse fields aren't normalized between
  platforms:**
  - Uber gives **duration in minutes** directly.
  - DoorDash gives a **deadline timestamp** (due time).
  - TTS / UI should work off a single canonical offer shape, computing
    whichever representation is needed (duration ↔ due time) rather than
    reading screen text verbatim.
- **Proposed fix:** canonical parsed offer schema; TTS announcement built
  from fields, never from raw strings.

#### 4. Uber offer overlay not captured by pipeline

- **Repro:** Receive an offer in Uber while in the field.
- **Observed:** Offer was not evaluated — no parsed data, no bubble update.
- **Hypothesis:** Uber renders some offers as a full-screen notification or
  system-overlay window rather than a normal app window; the current
  accessibility pipeline doesn't catch overlay-style surfaces.
- **Investigation TODO (back at desk):**
  - Check whether *any* data was captured for the missed offer.
  - If the `WindowChanged` pipeline still exists, see if it picked up
    anything. If not, this becomes a case for keeping/restoring it.

#### 6. Uber: persistent "currently online" notification dropped as noise

- **Current behavior:** `uber.notification.online_status`
  (`app/src/main/assets/rules/uber.json:218-225`) is classified
  `shape: "noise"` and dropped entirely. Match condition is
  `titleContains: "currently online"`.
- **Field observation — the body carries live flow state:** while on a
  delivery, the body reads things like "picking up from [store]" during
  the pickup leg, and "going to [customer address]" during the dropoff
  leg. The notification body reflects **which leg of the offer is active**.
- **Field observation — the actions also carry signal:** the active
  notification exposes action buttons that change with leg (e.g., a
  "Contact customer" button is present during dropoff). These are a
  structured, leg-correlated signal.
- **Why it matters:** given Uber's flowy UI (#5) and overlay-style offers
  (#4), this notification may be the most reliable continuous source of
  "what is the driver actually doing right now" on Uber.
- **Broader parser concern:** verify the notification parser is extracting
  **everything** Android exposes — title, text, sub-text, big-text,
  actions/buttons, action labels, action intents — not just title + body.
- **Proposed fix:** re-shape `uber.notification.online_status` from noise
  to parsed; expand parser to surface action buttons; route the parsed
  result as a flow-region/leg signal in the state machine. Likely tightly
  coupled to #1, #2, #5.

### Open questions / investigations

#### 7. How does Uber's slide-to-confirm surface in accessibility?

Uber uses slide-to-confirm widgets for advancing pickups and dropoffs (and
the "Go" button to start dashing may be similar). Three common
implementations:

1. **Slider/SeekBar-backed** — fires `ACTION_SET_PROGRESS` and emits
   `TYPE_VIEW_SCROLLED` accessibility events; we can detect "reached end."
2. **Custom view that dispatches a click on completion** — surfaces as a
   normal click event; a regular click rule keyed on the slider's node id
   catches it.
3. **Pure gesture-only surface with no accessibility action** — hardest;
   we'd have to infer from the screen transition that follows the slide.

Most production apps go with #1 or #2 because TalkBack users need it to
work. Worth confirming by capturing accessibility events while completing
a slide back at the desk.

**Field addition:** slide-to-confirm appears to be the standard
"advance to next leg" affordance on Uber pickups and dropoffs (likely
absent on shop-and-deliver — needs verification). This is the
**leg-transition signal** equivalent to DoorDash's "Arrived at store" /
"Complete delivery" buttons. Capturing it well is high-priority.

#### 9. Uber "match" screen — multiple concurrent offers

- **Observed:** Uber has a screen called the **match screen** that can
  display more than one offer at a time. Saw it in the field with multiple
  offers visible.
- **DoorDash analog:** none — DoorDash offers are presented one at a time.
- **Implication:** the offer evaluator and `OfferMatcher` may need to
  handle a list of offers, not a single-offer assumption.
- **Action:** capture this screen at the desk; design parser + evaluator to
  support N≥1 offers.

### Meta / architecture

#### 5. Uber UI is "flowy" — recognition strategy needs to differ from DoorDash

- DoorDash screens are discrete and separable; Uber screens blend into each
  other (shared chrome, persistent map background, transient sheets and
  overlays).
- Recognizing a screen on Uber is less about "exact tree match" and more
  about "what set of affordances is currently visible."
- **Action:** document the recognition strategy difference somewhere.
  Options considered:
  - This log entry (current home — fine for now).
  - A separate architecture issue.
  - `CLAUDE.md` addition.
  - **Per-rules-file README** — one alongside each `assets/rules/*.json`
    explaining how captures were used to identify screens, what fields were
    extracted, and any platform-specific quirks. (Probably the most
    maintainable; keeps platform-specific reasoning next to the rules it
    governs.)

### Research / design

#### 8. ZIP-derived zones as a first-class signal

- **Question:** is the platform-provided zone name even worth scraping, or
  is it an "extra" at best?
- **Problem with platform zones:** unreliable boundary semantics — dashing
  *in* zone X doesn't mean the pickup or dropoff is *in* zone X. A driver
  can leave the zone mid-offer (e.g., dashing in zone X but the offer's
  pickup is just outside, or the dropoff is several zones away).
- **Proposal:** extract the **ZIP code** from the customer dropoff address
  (and possibly pickup) and treat that as the canonical geo-signal. Hash
  the rest of the address as today, but keep the ZIP as a structured field.
- **Why it matters on both sides:**
  - **Academic federation:** "do tips correlate with ZIP demographics?" is
    a meaningful query and needs ZIP, not platform-zone.
  - **Driver side:** lets a dasher correlate earnings/tips by ZIP
    independent of platform zone definitions, which can change.
- **Open implementation questions:**
  - Pre-hash extraction (extract ZIP, then hash the rest) — needs the
    address parser to handle US format reliably.
  - ZIP → demographic classification — likely already exists (Census tract
    / USPS); confirm before reinventing.
  - Pickup-side ZIP useful too? Probably yes for restaurant-density /
    market context.

### Verification TODOs

#### 10. Accept-button capture consistency for this Uber session

- **Field condition:** developer accepted **every** offer in this session.
- **Action at desk:** cross-reference accept-button click events / sessions
  against the actual offers received during the session window. Any missing
  accepts indicate either matcher gaps, click-classifier gaps, or pipeline
  drops. Good ground-truth opportunity.
- **Related:** while doing this, also verify capture consistency of any
  pickup-confirm and dropoff-complete slide events from #7 — if those
  surface as click events, they should be present alongside the accepts.

## 2026-05-16 — DoorDash session (stacked pickups)

- **Platform tested:** DoorDash
- **Branch under test:** `master` at `af54b87` (post-#145 personal-economy-v2 merge — same build as the entry below)
- **Field conditions:** developer dashed on DoorDash and ran a stacked / double static order — two pickup stops at different merchants (first Best Buy, then Chick-fil-A), roughly a mile apart by car odometer. After the run, the in-app odometer read a few tenths of a mile short of the car odometer.

### Bugs

#### 1. Multi-stop pickup: second store doesn't register as a new pickup, and the inter-store drive isn't counted on the odometer

- **Repro:** Take a stacked order with two distinct pickup stops at different merchants. Complete pickup #1 (arrive, mark picked up — note that with a double *static* order you don't fully complete pickup #1 in the DoorDash UI, the platform just rolls you toward the next store while phase stays PICKUP). Drive to store #2.
- **Observed:** On approach to the second store, the bubble's store name updates from "Best Buy" to "Chick-fil-A". The app does **not** treat this as a new pickup — no "Pickup Started" bubble announcement, no new pickup lifecycle event. The drive between the two stores (~1 mi by car odometer) does not get counted; the dash mileage ends up a few tenths short of the car for the day, consistent with the entire inter-store leg being dropped.
- **Status:** Shipped in #262 (2026-05-18) — new `Task` minted on same-phase store change; `ResumeOdometer` fires naturally on the new pickup.
- **Expected:** Each store on a stacked run should be its own pickup — at minimum because the dasher has to navigate to the next store, so the mileage between them is real and unreimbursed if we don't log it. TNP per stop also wants per-store mileage attribution.
- **Framing (per the log narrative):** the missing odometer leg is almost certainly a downstream symptom of the missing pickup-transition event, so this is one entry covering both observations rather than two separate bugs.
- **Hypothesis (from a desk read, not verified against field logs):**
  - `PlatformRegionStepper.kt:401-441` is the smoking gun. The stepper branches on `currentTask.phase != taskPhase`. PICKUP → DROPOFF (or DROPOFF → PICKUP across orders) mints a new `Task` at `:409-425`. PICKUP → PICKUP (second pickup of a stack) falls into the same-phase `copy()` branch at `:430-441` and just mutates `storeName` on the existing `activeTask`. Same `taskId`, no transition boundary.
  - `EffectMap.kt:308-333` is the only path that emits `ResumeOdometer` for a starting pickup, and it's gated on `prevTask == null && nextTask != null` — false for a store-to-store mutation.
  - `EffectMap.kt:380-414` does detect the store-name change (`storeChanged` at `:387-388`) and emits a bubble update + a `PICKUP_NAV_STARTED` log entry titled "Store Name Updated" — but it does **not** emit any odometer effect.
  - Meanwhile `EffectMap.kt:361` fires `PauseOdometer` on first arrival at store #1. So the sequence is: arrive at Best Buy → `PauseOdometer` → drive to Chick-fil-A → storeName mutated in place → bubble & log update but **no `ResumeOdometer`** → odometer stays paused for the entire inter-store leg. That matches the "few tenths short" observation almost exactly.
- **What would confirm or refute this:** capture the state/effect stream across the Best Buy → Chick-fil-A handoff and check:
  - (a) does `activeTask.taskId` change across the two stores, or stay constant?
  - (b) is there a `PauseOdometer` on Best Buy arrival followed by **no** `ResumeOdometer` until Chick-fil-A arrival (or until something further downstream)?
  - (c) does the events table show a `PICKUP_NAV_STARTED` row with payload `{message: "Store Name Updated", previous: "Best Buy", updated: "Chick-fil-A"}` and no associated odometer delta between it and the prior arrival event?
- **Possible directions (sketches for triage, not a recommendation):**
  - *Option A — make the second store a real new pickup.* In `PlatformRegionStepper.updateTaskLifecycle`, treat a same-phase store-name change as a task boundary: complete the current `Task` and mint a new one. Existing `EffectMap.kt:308-333` wiring then resumes the odometer for free, and per-store mileage attribution falls out naturally.
  - *Option B — minimal patch in EffectMap.* Leave the in-place mutation alone, but emit `ResumeOdometer` from the `storeChanged` branch at `EffectMap.kt:380-414`. Smaller blast radius, but the schema still says "one task, multiple store legs," which probably bites later — TNP per stop wants the mileage bound to the *new* pickup, not appended to the previous one.
  - *Trade-off worth flagging:* option A is more invasive in the stepper and may surface latent assumptions in code that reads `region.activeTask` expecting it to be stable across a job. Option B is cheap but defers the data-model problem.
- **Tangentially related, worth checking while in this neighborhood:** does this affect single-pickup jobs that hot-swap store name during the unknown-resolution window (e.g. "Unknown" → real name once the matcher figures it out)? `:387-388` filters `nextName != "Unknown"`, so the *first* resolution probably doesn't trip the storeChanged branch, but a string-rewrite mid-pickup (e.g. "Best Buy" → "Best Buy #1234") would.

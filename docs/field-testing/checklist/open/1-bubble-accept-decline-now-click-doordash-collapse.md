issues: #1, #3

- **Bubble Accept/Decline now click DoorDash + collapse (re-test of 2026-06-09 #1 + #3, PR pending).**
  The click was searching the wrong window (`rootInActiveWindow` = the bubble); now it searches **all**
  windows, and the collapse cast was fixed (`findActivity`). To test: open the bubble (tap its head,
  since auto-expand is still off — that's the separate notification work), then on an offer tap
  **Accept** or **Decline** → confirm DashBuddy actually taps DoorDash's button (Accept accepts;
  Decline opens DoorDash's confirm), **and** the bubble **collapses to its head** afterward (vs
  dismiss — note which). Watch the log for `Performing offer action …` *without* a following
  `Could not find any live node`. Real orders — watch carefully.
  - Confirmed: 0/2.
  desk: needs field: tap the bubble's Accept/Decline controls and observe both the DoorDash action and collapse.
